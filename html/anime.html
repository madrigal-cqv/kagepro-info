                will be slightly different from the Manga and Novel. The character designs are

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>A story based on the popular series of songs by Jin titled Kagerou Project. Shintaro 
                Kisaragi—a NEET who shut himself inside his room for 2 years—has been living his 
                life normally until he met a cyber girl named Ene, who appeared in his computer 
                screen when someone anonymously sent him a mysterious e-mail one year ago. One 
                day, Ene messes with Shintaro's computer, which causes the computer to break and 
                forces Shintaro to enter the outside world for the first time in two years. He heads 
                to the department store, where a group of criminals break in and hold the people 
                inside hostage for ransom. Here he comes in contact with a group of teenagers calling 
                themselves the "Mekakushi Dan" (メカクシ団, lit. "Blindfold Gang"), who stop the 
                robbery with their mysterious eye powers and force Shintaro into joining their group.
