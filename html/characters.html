            <h2 id="no0">Ayano Tateyama</h2>
            <h3>No. 0</h3>
            <p>Ayano Tateyama (楯山 文乃 <em>Tateyama Ayano</em>) / Ayano (アヤノ) was a classmate and 
                friend of <a href="#no7">Shintaro Kisaragi</a>, the underclassman of 
                <a href="#no6">Takane Enomoto</a> and <a href="#no9">Haruka Kokonose</a> 
                and the daughter of Kenjirou Tateyama and Ayaka Tateyama. 
                She is the original founder of the Mekakushi Dan as Member No. 0 and the 
                older foster sister of <a href="#no1">Tsubomi Kido</a>, <a href="#no2">Kousuke 
                Seto</a> and <a href="#no3">Shuuya Kano</a>. Her
                eye ability, Favoring Eyes (目をかける Me wo Kakeru), allows her to project 
                her and possibly others' thoughts and memories to other people, 
                which she refers to as "the power of caring".
            </p>

            <h2 id="no1">Tsubomi Kido</h2>
            <h3>No. 1</h3>
            <p>Tsubomi Kido (木戸 つぼみ <em>Kido Tsubomi</em>) / Kido (キド) is the first member of the 
                Mekakushi Dan and currently its leader. She is the biological younger half-sister of 
                Rin Kido. She is the foster sister of <a href="#no2">Seto</a>, 
                <a href="#no3">Kano</a>, and <a href="#no0">Ayano Tateyama.</a> Her eye ability, 
                Concealing Eyes (目を隠す Me o Kakusu), allows her to divert perception away 
                from certain people and/or objects within 2 meters of themselves, making them 
                difficult to identify and practically invisible. Conversation between hidden people 
                won't be heard by outsiders; however, physical contact breaks the effect. Her ability 
                also allows her to conceal her own memories from herself.
            </p>

            <h2 id="no2">Kousuke Seto</h2>
            <h3>No. 2</h3>
            <p>
                Kousuke Seto (瀬戸 幸助 <em>Seto Kōsuke</em>) / Seto (セト) is the second member of the Mekakushi Dan.
                He is the foster brother of <a href="#no1">Kido</a>, <a href="#no3">Kano</a>, and 
                <a href="#no0">Ayano Tateyama.</a> and also <a href="#no4">Mary Kozakura</a>'s first friend.
                His eye ability, Stealing Eyes (目を盗む Me o Nusumu), allows him to hear the thoughts of others, 
                including animals. When used to its full potential, it can read a person's memories and experiences.
            </p>

            <h2 id="no3">Shuuya Kano</h2>
            <h3>No. 3</h3>
            <p>Shuuya Kano (鹿野 修哉 <em>Kano Shūya</em>) / Kano (カノ) is the third member of the Mekakushi Dan. 
                He's also the one who came up with the name Mekakushi Dan on his own initiative.
                He is the foster brother of <a href="#no1">Kido</a>, <a href="#no2">Seto</a>, and 
                <a href="#no0">Ayano Tateyama.</a> His eye ability, Deceiving Eyes (目を欺く Me wo Azamuku),
                allows him to change what people perceive him as; he can change how he appears, sounds, 
                and even feels to others and can thus impersonate other people and animals. He can only 
                use this ability on himself and not others.
            </p>

            <h2 id="no4">Mary Kozakura</h2>
            <h3>No. 4</h3>
            <p>
                Mary Kozakura (小桜 茉莉 <em>Kozakura Marī</em>) / Mary (マリー) is the fourth member 
                of the Mekakushi Dan. She is the daughter of Shion, as well as the granddaughter of 
                Azami and Tsukihiko. Mary has a power called "Locking Eyes", which she inherited 
                from her mother Shion and her grandmother Azami. It allows her to temporarily 
                paralyze whoever meets her gaze. It is not as complete as her mother's or 
                grandmother's power, as she is not able to turn people into stone, but it can 
                instead make them appear frozen for a few minutes.
            </p>


            <h2 id="no5">Momo Kisaragi</h2>
            <h3>No. 5</h3>
            <p>
                Momo Kisaragi (如月 桃 <em>Kisaragi Momo</em>) / Momo (モモ) is the fifth member of the Mekakushi Dan, 
                the little sister of <a href="#no7">Shintaro Kisaragi</a> and a recently new idol who is a 
                first-year in high-schooler in 10th grade. Her eye ability, Drawing Eyes (目を奪う Me o Ubau),
                allows her to draw peoples' attention to herself regardless of their preferences in tastes 
                or interests. She is also able to tell where a person's attention is drawn to.
            </p>

            <h2 id="no6">Ene</h2>
            <h3>No. 6</h3>
            <p>
                Ene (エネ) is a cyber girl who lives in <a href="#no7">Shintaro</a>'s computer and 
                becomes the sixth member of the Mekakushi Dan. She is secretly his former schoolmate 
                Takane Enomoto (榎本 貴音 Enomoto Takane) who lost her body two years ago. 
                She was the classmate of <a href="#no9">Haruka</a>, student of Kenjirou, 
                and upperclassman of both <a href="#no7">Shintaro</a> and <a href="#no0">Ayano.</a>
                Her eye ability, Opening Eyes (目が覚める Me ga Sameru), allows her to split her 
                spirit from her body, which then can reside in electronic devices (such as a 
                cellphone) as a cyber-being. Although she can be deleted from a device, 
                she will reappear as long as it is connected to the Internet.
            </p>

            <h2 id="no7">Shintaro Kisaragi</h2>
            <h3>No. 7</h3>
            <p>
                Shintaro Kisaragi (如月 伸太郎 <em>Kisaragi Shintarō</em>) / Shintaro (シンタロー) 
                is the main protagonist of the series. A digital girl named <a href="#no6">Ene</a>
                that lives inside his computer causes him to go outside for the first time in 
                two years, where he meets the Mekakushi Dan and becomes its seventh member.
            </p>

            <h2 id="no8">Amamiya Hibiya</h2>
            <h3>No. 8</h3>
            <p>
                Hibiya Amamiya (雨宮 響也 <em>Amamiya Hibiya</em>) / Hibiya (ヒビヤ) is the eighth member 
                of the Mekakushi Dan. During the present-day plot of the series, he and his 
                schoolmate Hiyori Asahina are visiting the city for a summer trip and are 
                staying at her brother-in-law's residence, where they meet <a href="#no9">Konoha.</a>
                His eye ability, Focusing Eyes (目を凝らす Me wo Korasu), has the power to perceive 
                objects and details that are far away from an aerial view by focus.
            </p>

            <h2 id="no9">Konoha</h2>
            <h3>No. 9</h3>
            <p>
                Konoha (コノハ) is the the 9th member of the Mekakushi Dan. He is a mysterious 
                man with apparent amnesia who is staying at Kenjirou's residence, 
                where he meets <a href="#no8">Hibiya</a> and Hiyori. His eye ability, 
                Awakening Eyes (目を醒ます Me wo Samasu),  gives him the power to remake his 
                body into one that its true owner, Haruka Kokonose, finds to be "ideal". Since 
                Haruka was physically weak and sickly, this caused Konoha to become 
                supernaturally strong.
